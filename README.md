# keyboard-autocorrect
This project implements a keyboard auto-correct system using Flask. It reads from a text corpus to build a vocabulary and calculate word probabilities. Users can input words, and the system suggests corrections based on word similarity using Jaccard distance, displaying the top 10 most likely corrections in real time.
